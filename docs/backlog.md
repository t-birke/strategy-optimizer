# Backlog & Roadmap

This is the **persistent** plan for the generic-strategy-screener branch.
Everything that isn't being worked on *right now* lives here so no plan ever
evaporates with a session.

Organized as:

1. **Phase 1** — foundation (in progress)
2. **Phase 2** — fitness, walk-forward, runner integration
3. **Phase 3** — block library expansion
4. **Phase 4** — persistence, queue, UI, deployment
5. **Phase 5** — AI idea generator (parked; separate effort)
6. **Deferred features** — good ideas we explicitly postponed
7. **Open questions** — undecided design calls

---

## 1. Phase 1 — Foundation

**Goal:** a composable runtime and a migration gate proving the new framework
reproduces the legacy JM Simple 3TP numbers exactly.

| # | Chunk | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | Block contract & registry (with pineTemplate method) | ✅ done |
| 2 | Spec format, loader, validator, content-hash identity | ✅ done |
| 3 | Dynamic param space derivation from spec | ✅ done |
| 4 | Multi-TF data layer with last-closed HTF semantics + volume | ✅ done |
| 5 | Indicator cache with dedup + non-close source support | ✅ done |
| 6 | Composable runtime engine (replaces strategy.js) | ✅ done |
| 6.5 | Sizing context enrichment (stats, planStop, equity curve) | ✅ done |
| 7 | Port current JM Simple 3TP logic into blocks | ✅ done |
| 8 | **MIGRATION GATE** — framework matches engine numbers + Pine indicator | ✅ done (A ✅, B ✅) |

**Exit criterion for Phase 1:** running the migration-gate spec through the new
framework produces a trade list that matches `engine/strategy.js` within
rounding, AND `npm run pine-push` of the generated entry-alert indicator fires
the same entry signals as the current Pine strategy.

**Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETE** — migration gate passes (8A aggregate metrics within
tolerance, 8B Pine indicator verified on TV chart firing on the runtime's
entry bars).

### 8A. Aggregate metrics parity — ✅ DONE

`scripts/parity-gate.js` runs `runStrategy()` (legacy) and `runSpec()` (new)
against BTCUSDT/4H from 2021-04-12 with the tuned 18-gene BTC winner. After
two targeted block fixes (remove entry-bar guards in `atrHardStop` close-based
SL and `structuralExit`), aggregate metrics land inside the ±0.5/±2/±2 % gate:

- trades  1023 → 1020   (−0.29 %)  ≤ 0.5 % ✓
- PF      1.339 → 1.341 (+0.18 %)  ≤ 2 % ✓
- netPct  +$236 k → +$240 k (+1.64 %) ≤ 2 % ✓
- TP1 / TP2 / TP3 / Time exit counts match bit-for-bit.

**Residual divergences (~720 trade-by-trade mismatches):** cascade from slot
evaluation-order differences — runtime evaluates hardStop → target → trail
with position-close short-circuit semantics that differ subtly from legacy's
monolithic step order. First divergence around trade #121; downstream trades
then shift entry timing. Aggregate metrics match, so the residual is
deferred — follow up in Phase 2 when the composable runtime becomes
authoritative. Tracked in "Deferred features" below.

### 8B. Pine entry-alert codegen — ✅ DONE

Full position-aware indicator generator, verified on TV chart against the
runtime's entry timestamps for the BTCUSDT/4H BTC-winner gene.

- `engine/pine-codegen.js` — walks the hydrated spec, calls each entry/
  filter/regime block's `pineTemplate(params, paramRefs)` with literal refs,
  stitches into an overlay indicator with score-mode aggregation. Also emits
  a generic **exit state machine** (`emitExitStateMachine`) that iterates
  the spec's exit slots (hardStop / target / trail) and TP tranches (1–6),
  tracks `pos_dir` / `pos_entry` / `pos_entry_atr_*`, gates duplicate entry
  signals while in-position, and fires `plotshape`/`label` markers + JSON
  webhook payloads on both entries and exits. Boxed-sticker labels
  (`label.style_label_up/down`) with tails point at the bar — LONG/SHORT on
  entries, the exit reason (`TP1`/`TP2`/`TP3`/`SL`/`ESL`/`Time`/
  `Structural`/`Reversal`) on exits.
- `scripts/pine-export.js` — offline codegen + `--diff` against
  `pine/jm_3tp_alerts.pine` reference.
- `scripts/pine-deploy.js` — full deploy pipeline with collision check,
  in-place overwrite (via `tv pine open <name>` → `pine set` → save, so TV
  doesn't auto-suffix " 1" on the saved script), toolbar-Save-button click
  with full React pointer sequence (Ctrl+S no-ops after `pine set` because
  Monaco's model API bypasses the dirty tracker), flip-state verify
  (`unsaved-` → `saved-`), Monaco-severity-filtered compile check, and
  round-trip source verification.

**v1 Pine simplifications vs runtime** (documented, not bugs — runtime
remains source-of-truth for backtests; indicator is alerts-only):
- SL uses 1-bar defer; runtime uses 2-bar.
- First TP hit closes the whole position; runtime scales out per tranche.
- No BE+ SL tightening after TP1.

**Residual non-blocking warnings** — 4 Monaco severity-4 warnings about
`ta.crossover`/`ta.crossunder` called inside a ternary inside the struct-arm
gate. Cosmetic only; compile + runtime behavior are fine. Fix: extract
crossUp/crossDown to top-level series before the ternary. Punted as a
cleanup item.

---

## 2. Phase 2 — Fitness, walk-forward, runner integration 🟡 ACTIVE

**Goal:** the GA optimizes specs end-to-end with proper overfitting protection.

### 2.1 Fitness function (`optimizer/fitness.js`, new)
- Weighted scalar: `w_pf · norm(PF) + w_dd · (1 − maxDD%) + w_ret · norm(net)`
- Read weights/caps/gates from `spec.fitness` (defaults in `spec.js` already).
- Hard gates: `minTradesPerWindow`, `worstRegimePfFloor`, `wfeMin`.
- Gate failures → fitness = 0 (strategy eliminated, not just penalized).
- Unit tests: known synthetic metrics → known fitness values.

### 2.2 Walk-forward harness (`optimizer/walk-forward.js`, new)
- Two schemes: `anchored` (growing IS window) and `rolling` (fixed-width IS slide).
- Per spec: `nWindows` refits.
- For each window: fit on IS, evaluate frozen gene on OOS, record OOS PF & net.
- Compute **WFE** = `mean(OOS_PF) / IS_PF`.
- Report: per-window trade counts, PFs, return, WFE aggregate.
- **Important:** shipped params come from the **full-data fit**, NOT from WF.
  WF is the robustness gate only.

### 2.3 Regime stratification in fitness ✅ done
- Runtime emits `regimeBreakdown` per label with `{trades, wins, pf, net, grossProfit, grossLoss}` — gross P/L added so downstream can pool PFs correctly by summing, not by averaging ratios.
- Fitness queries `worstRegimePf = min(regimeBreakdown.*.pf)` and fails if `< gates.worstRegimePfFloor`.
- Sample-size floor `MIN_REGIME_SAMPLE = 5`: regimes below that threshold are skipped. If no regime has enough samples, the gate is skipped entirely (no fail-open).
- **WF-aware path**: when a `wfReport` with per-window `oosRegimeBreakdown` is supplied, those slices are *pooled* (summing `grossProfit`/`grossLoss`) and the gate uses the pooled OOS stats instead of the full-data breakdown. `breakdown.regimeSource` reports `'wf-oos-pooled'` or `'full-data'`.
- `walkForward()` now records `isRegimeBreakdown` and `oosRegimeBreakdown` on every window report so this pipe-through works.
- Tests: 25 new assertions in `fitness-check.js` (groups 14–17) covering pooling math, fallback to trade-weighted PF when gross P/L absent, pooled-OOS *stricter* than full-data, pooled-OOS *rescuing* a gene full-data would eliminate, and fallback when WF has no regime data. Total: **92/92 pass**.
- Docs updated in `docs/spec-guide.md` (fitness section and regime-stratification section).

### 2.4 Runner integration (`optimizer/runner.js`, `optimizer/island-worker.js`) ✅ done
- **Spec-mode fork** added behind a `config.spec` flag — when present, the runner validates the spec, builds the paramSpace, packs an extra `ts` column into the SharedArrayBuffer, and ships the raw spec object into each worker via `workerData.spec`. When absent, the legacy contract (used by the UI server's `POST /api/runs`) is **byte-for-byte unchanged**.
- **Worker** rebuilds the paramSpace itself (functions don't survive structured-clone), calls `registry.ensureLoaded()` first because each Worker has a fresh module graph, then swaps the legacy `runStrategy + score formula` for `runSpec → computeFitness`. The composite score is mapped from `[0, 1]` to `[0, 1000]` so it sits in roughly the same magnitude as the legacy fitness; eliminated genes get `-10000` so they sort below the legacy soft-penalty band `[-5000, -1000]`.
- **Diagnostics**: in spec mode the worker stamps `metrics._fitness = { score, eliminated, gatesFailed, breakdown, reason? }` so the UI can show *which gate killed which gene*.
- **Shared candle transport** kept (zero-copy SAB) — re-loading from DuckDB per worker was rejected because the SAB extension to 6 columns was a one-line change and DuckDB has lock contention with the UI server.
- **HTFs deferred** to Phase 2.6: the runner throws if `spec.htfs` is non-empty so multi-TF specs fail loud rather than silently using only the base.
- **Walk-forward not run per-generation**: per-gene WF every generation would multiply runtime by `nWindows`. Phase 2.4 keeps WF a one-shot post-GA step (the harness already exists in `optimizer/walk-forward.js`); a future 2.4b can promote selected top-N to per-gen WF if needed.
- **Verification**: new `scripts/runner-spec-mode-check.js` runs a tiny GA (pop=8, gens=3) on the migration-gate spec in **both** modes and asserts: bestGene uses spec QIDs (e.g. `emaTrend.main.emaFast`) in spec mode and flat names in legacy mode; `_fitness` diagnostics present in spec mode and absent in legacy mode; both modes complete without crashing. Currently **13/13 ✓**.

**Phase 2 verification status**:
- `fitness-check`: 92/92 ✓
- `walk-forward-check`: 35/35 ✓
- `runner-spec-mode-check`: 13/13 ✓
- `fitness-cache-check`: 41/41 ✓
- `parity-gate (8A)`: ✓ PASS

### 2.5 Fitness cache ✅ done
- **Persistent per-(spec, dataset) cache** in `optimizer/fitness-cache.js`. Each
  `(spec.hash, datasetId)` pair gets its own JSON file under
  `data/fitness-cache/` (or `OPTIMIZER_FITNESS_CACHE_DIR`). The on-disk file
  uses just `geneKey` as the within-file key — a different spec or different
  dataset gets a different file, full stop, no shared keys.
- **Dataset identity** = `sha256(symbol:tfMin:startDate:endDate:bars:lastTs)`.
  The trailing `bars`+`lastTs` catches the case where the candle DB was
  updated since the last run — same window, more data → different id →
  cache invalidated automatically.
- **Top-N cap (50,000)** keeps disk + load time bounded. The GA tends to
  *revisit* high-fitness regions across runs, so caching the long tail of
  mediocre genes buys little. `filterAndCap` drops anything with
  `fitness ≤ 0` (eliminated genes / soft-penalty band — re-runs would hit
  the same gate anyway, no real backtest is saved) and keeps the top-N by
  fitness desc.
- **Atomic writes**: write to `.tmp` then `rename`, so a crashed run can't
  leave a half-written file shadowing a good one.
- **Wired into `runner.js`** (spec mode only; legacy mode is unchanged):
  `loadCache` runs before workers spawn, the preload map is shipped via
  `workerData.fitnessCachePreload`, each worker hydrates its in-memory
  `fitnessCache` Map from it, and on `get_results` each worker ships back
  a `cacheSnapshot` which the runner merges + saves. `runOptimization`
  return value gains a `fitnessCache: { datasetId, preloadCount,
  savedCount, droppedCount, path }` block (null in legacy mode).
- **Verification**: new `scripts/fitness-cache-check.js` exercises 8 groups
  (computeDatasetId determinism+sensitivity, save→load round-trip, top-N
  cap, filtering of eliminated/NaN/null entries, invalidation by spec or
  dataset change, corrupt-file non-fatal, mergeCaches collision, and an
  end-to-end test running two GA runs to confirm `run2.preloadCount ===
  run1.savedCount`). Currently **41/41 ✓**.

**Exit criterion for Phase 2:** end-to-end GA run on the migration-gate spec
produces tuned params, a WF report, a regime breakdown, and a scalar fitness —
all written to disk and visible in the UI. **All 5 verification gates green
as of 2026-04-15** — Phase 2 functionally complete pending Phase 2.6 (HTF
support in walk-forward + runner spec mode).

---

## 3. Phase 3 — Block library expansion

**Goal:** enough blocks to express a reasonable breadth of strategies without
writing new blocks for each one.

### Entry blocks
- `stochCross` ✅ (needed for migration gate)
- `emaTrend` ✅ (needed for migration gate)
- `bbSqueezeBreakout` ✅ (needed for migration gate)
- `orb` — opening-range breakout (session-based)
- `rangeBreakout` — breakout from N-bar range
- `maPullback` — pullback to MA during trend
- `rsiPullback` — RSI oversold/overbought in trend
- `vwapReclaim` — price reclaiming VWAP (intraday)
- `volumeSurge` — entry on volume spike with price confirmation
- `donchianBreakout` — classic turtle-style

### Filter blocks
- `htfTrendFilter` — only longs above HTF MA
- `sessionFilter` — time-of-day gating
- `volumeFilter` — min volume multiple of average
- `volatilityFloor` — min ATR / BB width
- `spreadFilter` — reject wide-spread bars (needs spread data — future)
- `regimeGate` — filter on regime label

### Regime blocks
- `htfTrendRegime` — HTF MA slope → bull/chop/bear
- `volRegime` — ATR percentile → low/normal/high
- `rangeRegime` — ADX-based trending vs ranging
- `sessionRegime` — asia/london/ny (intraday)

### Exit blocks
- **hardStop:** `atrHardStop` ✅, `pctHardStop`, `structuralHardStop`
- **target:** `atrScaleOutTarget` ✅ (generic up-to-6-tier, zero overhead
  for unused tiers — pinning `tpNPct=0` removes the tranche from both the
  genome and the runtime), `rrTarget`, `fibExtTarget`. `singleTpTarget`
  is unnecessary — just use `atrScaleOutTarget` with a single active
  tranche.
- **trail:** `atrTrail`, `chandelierTrail`, `maTrail`, `structuralExit` ✅,
  `timeStop` (note: `timeStop` as standalone is redundant with
  `structuralExit.maxBars` — fold into whatever trail a spec uses rather
  than shipping a separate block).

### Sizing blocks (covered in chunk 6.5)
- `flat` — fixed dollar amount
- `pctOfEquity` — % of current equity
- `pctOfInitial` — % of starting capital
- `atrRisk` — Van Tharp risk-per-trade (needs `stopDistance`)
- `martingale` — escalate after losses
- `antiMartingale` — escalate after wins
- `kelly` — Kelly-fraction based on running stats
- `fixedFractional` — Ralph Vince
- `equityCurveTrading` — meta-sizing based on equity vs its MA
- `volTargetSizing` — scaled to hit target portfolio volatility

### Library housekeeping
- `engine/blocks/library/index.js` — imports every block file, registers them.
- Per-block unit tests: contract validation + a deterministic fixture.
- **Lookahead detection harness** (`engine/blocks/lookahead-check.js`):
  call `onBar` for each bar with candles[>i] and indicators[>i] set to NaN;
  any block that reads those values gets flagged.

---

## 4. Phase 4 — Persistence, queue, UI, deployment

### 4.1 Database schema migration (`db/schema.sql`) ✅ done
- **Extended `runs` table** with 5 additive columns via `ALTER TABLE ADD
  COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` (legacy rows leave them NULL):
  - `spec_hash VARCHAR` — pointer to `specs.hash`
  - `spec_name VARCHAR` — denormalized for cheap listing without a join
  - `wf_report_json JSON` — post-GA walk-forward report on the winning
    gene (scheme, nWindows, per-window IS/OOS PF + trades, meanIsPf,
    meanOosPf, WFE). Populated by Phase 4.1b (see below).
  - `fitness_breakdown_json JSON` — `bestMetrics._fitness` (score,
    eliminated, gatesFailed, breakdown.normPf/normDd/normRet, regimeSource,
    worstRegimePf)
  - `regime_breakdown_json JSON` — `bestMetrics.regimeBreakdown`
- **New `specs` table** — content-addressed store of validated spec JSON,
  keyed by `spec.hash`. Upsert is idempotent: identical hash is a no-op so
  multiple runs of the same spec share one row. Lets `runs.spec_hash`
  always resolve back to the exact JSON we optimized, even if the on-disk
  strategy file has since been edited.
- **New `db/specs.js` helpers**: `upsertSpec(spec)`, `getSpec(hash)`,
  `listSpecs()`. `getSpec` parses the stored JSON, `listSpecs` returns
  metadata only (no payload) for cheap UI listings.
- **`api/routes.js` wiring**: POST `/api/runs` now accepts an optional
  `spec` field — either an inline object or a filename string under
  `strategies/` (with `..` + absolute-path traversal rejected). Spec mode
  gets validated + upserted at enqueue, `spec_hash` + `spec_name` stored
  on the runs row immediately. On completion the queue processor writes
  `fitness_breakdown_json` + `regime_breakdown_json` from `bestMetrics`.
  Legacy runs (no spec) continue through the existing code path with all
  5 new columns left NULL.
- **Deferred**: `queue` table. The backlog sketch put it under 4.1 but
  its schema depends on the queue design (polling model, status fsm,
  priority semantics), which belongs to 4.2 where we build the actual
  consumer. Shipping a skeleton now would commit us to a shape we'd
  iterate on — see follow-up 4.2.
- **Verification**: new `scripts/db-schema-check.js` runs against the
  parity DB (which has candles loaded), asserts the 5 new columns exist,
  the `specs` table is shaped correctly, `upsertSpec` is idempotent,
  `getSpec` round-trips JSON, `listSpecs` returns metadata, and an
  end-to-end tiny GA writes through the full pipeline and reads back
  with all 5 columns populated (including `wf_report_json`). Cleans up
  its own test rows. Currently **40/40 ✓**.

### 4.1b Post-GA walk-forward on the winner ✅ done
- **`optimizer/runner.js`**: after the GA finishes (spec mode only), the
  runner hands the winning gene to `walkForward({ optimize: () => gene,
  ... })` — a frozen-gene evaluation across the IS/OOS windows, not a
  re-optimization. Cheap (~0.1s on an 11k-bar BTCUSDT/4H run). Runs
  inside try/catch — any failure falls back to `wfReport = null` so the
  GA result is never lost. Gated on `specMode && !cancelSent`.
- **Return shape**: `runOptimization` now returns `wfReport` alongside
  `bestGene`/`bestMetrics`. Legacy mode always returns `wfReport: null`
  (no validated spec to hand to the harness).
- **`api/routes.js` queue processor**: on completion, `result.wfReport`
  is serialized into `runs.wf_report_json` using the same NULL-safe
  write path as `fitness_breakdown_json` / `regime_breakdown_json`.
- **Verification**:
  - `scripts/runner-spec-mode-check.js` extended with WF assertions
    (scheme = anchored, nWindows = 5, per-window isPf/oosPf finite,
    legacy mode still emits `wfReport = null`). 21/21 ✓.
  - `scripts/db-schema-check.js` extended to read back the `wf_report_json`
    column after the tiny GA and assert round-trip shape. 40/40 ✓.

### 4.2 Run queue

### 4.2a Pullable atomic claim ✅ done
- **Design call**: don't add a separate `queue` table. `runs.status='pending'`
  is already the queue — a parallel table would duplicate state and
  introduce a sync problem. Phase 4.2a evolves `runs` into a pullable queue
  instead.
- **Schema adds** (additive, `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`):
  - `priority INTEGER DEFAULT 0` — higher runs first (`ORDER BY priority
    DESC, id ASC`). Default 0 preserves legacy FIFO-by-id behavior.
  - `claimed_by VARCHAR` — worker identifier (e.g. hostname.pid). NULL
    while pending or after stale-lease recovery.
  - `claimed_at TIMESTAMP` — set atomically when transitioning to running.
  - `heartbeat_at TIMESTAMP` — worker pings; stale rows get swept back.
  - `cancel_requested BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE` — UI → worker signal.
- **`db/queue.js`** — new helpers:
  - `claimNextRun({ workerId })` — atomic `UPDATE runs SET status='running',
    ... WHERE id = (SELECT id ... LIMIT 1) RETURNING *`. DuckDB serializes
    the statement, so two concurrent callers can never win the same row.
    Sweeps `pending` rows with `cancel_requested=TRUE` to `cancelled`
    before the claim.
  - `heartbeat(runId)` — bumps `heartbeat_at`; returns `false` if the row
    isn't running (caller can fail fast).
  - `recoverStaleRuns({ timeoutMs })` — sweeps `running` rows with
    `heartbeat_at < NOW - timeout` back to `pending`. Rounds up to whole
    seconds for DuckDB `INTERVAL` arithmetic.
  - `completeRun(runId, { status, bestGene, ..., wfReportJson, ... })` —
    writes terminal status + all result JSON fields. NULL-safe for
    optional spec-mode fields (fitness/regime/wf reports).
  - `requestCancel(runId)` — flags a `pending`|`running` row for
    cancellation.
  - `listQueue()` — metadata snapshot of pending + running (no big JSON
    payloads) for future UI queue viewer.
- **`db/connection.js`**: added `CHECKPOINT` after schema replay. DuckDB
  can't reliably replay ALTER-with-DEFAULT entries from the WAL (internal
  "GetDefaultDatabase with no default database set" assertion). The
  CHECKPOINT moves migrations into the base file so subsequent opens skip
  WAL replay. Schema is idempotent so the re-run cost is negligible.
- **Verification**: new `scripts/queue-claim-check.js` — 8 test groups,
  **36/36 ✓**:
  1. Schema: 5 new columns on `runs`.
  2. Atomic claim under Promise.all: two concurrent claims return
     different rows with correct bookkeeping.
  3. Priority ordering: claim honors `priority DESC, id ASC`.
  4. Heartbeat updates timestamp; no-op on non-running rows.
  5. Stale-lease recovery: 10-min-old heartbeat gets swept back to pending
     and is re-claimable.
  6. `requestCancel` on pending → next claim sweeps to `cancelled` and
     skips to the next row.
  7. `completeRun` round-trips full result payload (bestGene, metrics,
     fitness/wf breakdowns) through DuckDB JSON columns.
  8. `listQueue` excludes terminal rows, priority-ordered.

### 4.2b In-process drain on DB-backed queue ✅ done

**Scope redefined after user clarification**: the optimizer runs as a single
process on a single machine (Windows box, RTX 3090, 12×8 islands). There's
no immediate need for multi-machine workers, so 4.2b collapses to
"refactor the existing in-process queue to use the 4.2a helpers". The
HTTP-API-for-remote-workers sketch is parked in section 6 (Deferred
features → Remote optimizer workers).

- **`api/routes.js` refactor**: the in-memory `runQueue` array is gone.
  `processQueue` now drives the GA off DB state:
  1. `claimNextRun({ workerId })` atomically transitions the highest-
     priority pending row to `running` and returns it.
  2. The row's `config` JSON (written at enqueue by POST `/api/runs`)
     is parsed to reconstruct the `runOptimization` args — every GA knob
     that used to live on `runQueue[i]` (populationSize, generations,
     migration/space-travel params, minTrades, maxDrawdownPct, knockout*,
     endDate, label) is persisted on the row, so a restart doesn't lose
     the config.
  3. Spec-mode runs resolve `row.spec_hash` via `getSpec(hash)` and hand
     the fetched JSON to `runOptimization`.
  4. A 10s heartbeat interval (`setInterval(() => heartbeat(runId), ...)`)
     keeps the row live against `recoverStaleRuns`.
  5. On completion `completeRun(runId, { status, bestGene, bestMetrics,
     topResults, generationLog, fitnessBreakdownJson, regimeBreakdownJson,
     wfReportJson, generationsCompleted, totalEvaluations, error })`
     writes the terminal state. Legacy-mode rows leave the spec-only JSON
     columns NULL.
  6. `processQueue` is idempotent — a second kick while already draining
     is a no-op (`processing` guard). Exported so tests can drive it
     without a running server.
- **Enqueue (POST `/api/runs`)**: writes the full GA config as a single
  JSON blob on `runs.config` (plus `spec_hash`/`spec_name` for spec-mode).
  Then just kicks `processQueue()`.
- **Cancel (POST `/api/runs/:id/cancel`)**: uses `requestCancel(id)` as
  the source of truth. If the id matches the active run, also flips the
  in-process `cancelRequested` flag so the runner's `shouldCancel()`
  callback sees it mid-GA (the flag + the DB row are kept in sync).
- **Queue view (GET `/api/queue`)**: uses `listQueue()` for the pending
  snapshot, still surfaces the in-process active run for friendly labels.
- **Startup recovery (`server.js`)**: replaced the old bulk
  `UPDATE runs SET status='failed' WHERE status='running'` with
  `recoverStaleRuns({ timeoutMs: 1_000 })`. Semantics change: a crash or
  restart now requeues `running` rows back to `pending` instead of
  failing them. Matches how Celery/Sidekiq default — the user enqueued
  the work, a crash shouldn't silently drop it. If we ever want "fail
  after N attempts" we'll add an `attempts` counter on the row and cap
  in `processQueue`.
- **Queue helper tweak** (`db/queue.js`): `recoverStaleRuns` now also
  matches `heartbeat_at IS NULL` (not just "older than timeout"). A
  legacy or crashed row with no heartbeat is definitionally stale — no
  heartbeat could have fired while we were down. This is what makes the
  single-process `{ timeoutMs: 1_000 }` startup call work.
- **Verification**:
  - `scripts/queue-claim-check.js` extended with group [5b] exercising
    the NULL-heartbeat recovery path. **38/38 ✓**.
  - New `scripts/queue-drain-check.js` — integration test driving the
    refactored `processQueue` end-to-end. Four scenarios:
    1. Happy path: enqueue tiny legacy run → drain → status=completed
       with populated `best_gene`/`best_metrics`/`generations_completed`
       (skipped automatically when BTCUSDT/240 candles aren't in the
       parity DB).
    2. Bad `spec_hash` → processQueue traps `getSpec` miss and marks the
       row `failed` with `error='spec load error: …'`; drain loop
       survives for next kick.
    3. (Removed: malformed JSON in `config` is blocked by DuckDB's
       JSON-type validation at INSERT time. The try/catch in
       processQueue is defensive but unreachable on the current schema.)
    4. `requestCancel` on pending rows → claim sweeps them to
       `cancelled` without ever invoking `runOptimization` (no
       `best_gene`, no generations run).
    Isolates itself from other pending rows in the parity DB by parking
    them to `status='pending_parked'` for the duration of the test. **9/9 ✓**
    on the parity DB.
  - Full-suite re-run post-refactor: `db-schema-check` 40/40, `fitness-check`
    92/92, `fitness-cache-check` 41/41, `walk-forward-check` 35/35,
    `smoke-migration-gate` ALL OK, `parity-gate` ✓ PASS,
    `runner-spec-mode-check` 21/21, `queue-claim-check` 38/38,
    `queue-drain-check` 9/9. All green.

### 4.2c CLI (`scripts/queue.js`) ✅ done

- **`scripts/queue.js`** — thin HTTP client over the optimizer server's
  queue endpoints. Four commands:
  - `add <symbol> <tf> [--spec … --pop N --gens N --mut F --islands N
    --planets N --min-trades N --max-dd PCT --start YYYY-MM-DD
    --end YYYY-MM-DD]` — POSTs `/api/runs`. Normalizes `tf` either as
    minute count (`240`) or label (`4H`). Symbol upper-cased.
  - `list [--running]` — GETs `/api/queue`, prints active + pending
    with priority + spec name + label.
  - `cancel <id>` — POSTs `/api/runs/:id/cancel`.
  - `recover [--timeout-ms N]` — POSTs `/api/queue/recover`.
- **Why HTTP (not direct DB)**: single-process mode means the server is
  the sole DB writer; DuckDB locks the file. Cancels also need to flip
  the in-process `cancelRequested` flag, which only the server process
  can do. The HTTP endpoint already does both.
- **New endpoint `POST /api/queue/recover`** on `api/routes.js`: body
  `{ timeoutMs? }`, defaults 60s, returns `{ recovered, timeoutMs }`.
  Defensive bump of the active run's heartbeat before the sweep so an
  aggressive `--timeout-ms 1000` call can't yank the row the current
  process is still executing; the caller should `cancel` the run
  explicitly if they want to abandon it.
- **Env**: `OPTIMIZER_HOST` (default `localhost`), `OPTIMIZER_PORT`
  (default `3000`). Zero-dependency — uses native `fetch`.
- **Known limitations** (documented in the CLI with WARN stderr, not
  silent drops):
  - `--priority <N>` is parsed but ignored — `POST /api/runs` doesn't
    currently expose a priority knob. Extend `routes.js` if needed.
  - `--label <str>` is ignored — label is derived server-side from the
    interval.
- **Verification**: new `scripts/queue-cli-check.js` — spawns a fake
  HTTP server (per test case), runs `scripts/queue.js` as a subprocess,
  asserts the exact method+path+body the CLI sends and the stdout/
  stderr/exit-code it produces. 8 scenarios, **41/41 ✓**:
  1. `list` on empty queue.
  2. `list --running` with an active row present (filters pending).
  3. `add` with spec + flags (verifies `--pop`/`--gens`/`--start` map
     to `populationSize`/`generations`/`startDate`, tf-minutes → label,
     symbol uppercased).
     - 3b: `tf=1H` label accepted as-is.
     - 3c: unknown tf rejected without hitting server.
  4. `cancel 42` hits the right URL.
     - 4b: non-numeric id rejected without hitting server.
  5. `recover --timeout-ms 30000` forwards the value; `recovered`
     count printed back.
     - 5b: default 60_000 when no flag.
  6. Unknown command → non-zero exit + usage on stdout.
  7. Server unreachable (bound-port=1 refused) → non-zero exit +
     "server not reachable" in stderr.
  8. `--priority` emits a clearly visible WARN on stderr.

### 4.2d In-process cancel propagation — ✅ done
Belt-and-suspenders path for `cancel_requested` to reach the runner when
the HTTP cancel endpoint wasn't the trigger. Single-process mode with
the current `POST /api/runs/:id/cancel` already flips the in-process
`cancelRequested` flag synchronously, so this is primarily insurance
for (a) a future CLI that writes directly to the DB, and (b) the
remote-worker shape listed under Deferred.

**Mechanism** (api/routes.js):
- New `cancelPollTimer` state var alongside `heartbeatTimer`.
- `CANCEL_POLL_MS = 2_000` — one small `SELECT cancel_requested FROM
  runs WHERE id = ?` per interval. Latency is imperceptible for a human
  clicking Cancel; DB load is negligible.
- One-shot latch: once the poll observes TRUE it stops querying (the
  flag is monotonic — no un-cancel).
- Lifecycle matched to heartbeat: started after `claimNextRun` succeeds,
  cleared in the same `finally` block that clears `heartbeatTimer`. No
  leak if the runner throws.

**Why not "runner.js polls the DB"?** The runner already has
`shouldCancel()` — a function pointer the caller supplies. Putting the
DB poll in routes.js keeps the runner pure (no DB dependency) and lets
future non-queue callers of `runOptimization` (one-off scripts, the
existing legacy `POST /api/optimize` path) keep using their own cancel
source.

**Verification** — `queue-drain-check.js` test [5]:
- Replicates the poll block in isolation against a test row.
- Confirms flag stays false with `cancel_requested=FALSE`.
- After `UPDATE cancel_requested = TRUE`, flag flips within one poll
  interval (test uses 500ms for speed; prod uses 2s).
- Confirms the one-shot latch: poll count stops growing once flipped.
- End-to-end through `processQueue` is covered implicitly by the
  happy-path test when real candles are present; the runner already
  reads `cancelRequested` via `shouldCancel` every generation.

### 4.3 UI — spec authoring

Broken into sub-chunks (each its own commit):
- **4.3a** — Backend: `GET /api/specs` + `GET /api/blocks`.
- **4.3b** — UI: spec picker in existing New Run modal.
- **4.3c** — UI: new spec authoring page with block picker per slot.
- **4.3d** — UI: per-block param narrowing form (min/max/step or pin).
- **4.3e** — Save: `POST /api/specs` writes to `strategies/` after validation. ✅ done

### 4.3a Backend endpoints for the authoring UI — ✅ done
Two read-only endpoints that feed the upcoming authoring UI. Neither
touches the queue or DuckDB; both are safe to call any time.

- **`GET /api/specs`** — enumerates `strategies/*.json`. Returns
  `{ specs: [{ filename, name, description, sizeBytes, mtime }], malformed: [{ filename, error }] }`.
  Files that fail to parse or lack a top-level `name` get reported in
  `malformed[]` so the picker can surface a warning without hiding the
  file. **Does not run `validateSpec()`** — that's expensive (loads the
  block library to check references) and the picker only needs shape-
  level trust. Full validation still happens on `POST /api/runs`.
- **`GET /api/blocks`** — dumps the in-memory block registry via
  `registry.ensureLoaded()`. Each entry: `{ id, version, kind, direction, exitSlot, sizingRequirements, params }`.
  `params[]` comes from `block.declaredParams()` so the UI knows each
  param's `type` + `min`/`max`/`step` bounds for the narrowing form.
  `direction` null on regime/sizing; `exitSlot` non-null only on exit
  blocks; `sizingRequirements` (e.g. `['stopDistance']`) only on sizing
  blocks that declare it. Sorted by (kind, id, version) so clients can
  diff responses.

**Verification** — `scripts/spec-api-check.js` (387 checks ✓):
- Boots a bare Express app with the real router.
- `/api/specs` includes the legacy baseline spec with all documented fields.
- `/api/blocks` invariants: valid kind/direction/exitSlot per block kind,
  every declared param has `id/type/min/max/step` with `min<max, step>0`.
- Anchors: `stochCross` has exactly `[longLevel, shortLevel, stochLen, stochSmth]`;
  `atrHardStop` has `exitSlot=hardStop`; `atrRisk` has `sizingRequirements=['stopDistance']`.
- Sort order is non-regressing across the block list.

### 4.3c Spec authoring page (block picker per slot) — ✅ done
New top-level "Specs" page that lets the user compose a strategy spec
by picking blocks per slot. Live JSON preview on the right; "Copy JSON"
button dumps to clipboard. Saving to `strategies/<name>.json` is still
manual — POST /api/specs lands in 4.3e. Per-param narrowing (tighter
min/max/step, pinning) is 4.3d; for now each block's params use the
registry-declared range as-is, which is a valid runnable starting point.

- **Nav + page** (`ui/index.html`): new `<a data-page="specs">` link;
  new `#page-specs` container with two-column grid — left = editor
  form, right = sticky live JSON preview.
- **Editor form**: name/description; regime (single, optional); entries
  (mode all/any/score + threshold + multi-block list); filters (mode +
  multi-block list); three exit slots (hardStop/target/trail, each
  optional); sizing (required). Each row's dropdown is filtered by
  block `kind` (and for exits, by `exitSlot`).
- **Wiring** (`ui/app.js`): `loadBlocksForEditor()` fetches `/api/blocks`
  at init and caches into `blocksById`. `buildSpecFromUi()` reads the
  DOM and composes the full spec object; `renderSpecPreview()` stringifies
  it and updates the preview on every input/change. Sizing block's
  `sizingRequirements` surface as a muted hint under the sizing row
  (flags `stopDistance` → requires Hard Stop). Threshold row auto-hides
  when entries mode ≠ score.
- **Validation** (non-blocking): name required, ≥1 entry block, sizing
  required, and (iff sizing needs stopDistance) a Hard Stop pick. Issues
  render as a muted line above the preview; authoritative check still
  happens server-side at save (4.3e).
- **Copy JSON**: uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText` with a textarea +
  `execCommand('copy')` fallback for non-secure contexts (localhost http).

**Verification** — `scripts/ui-spec-editor-check.js` (225 checks ✓):
- DOM: nav link + #page-specs + every spec-* field (name/desc/regime,
  entries mode+threshold+list+add, filters mode+list+add, three exit
  slots, sizing + requirements hint, JSON preview, Copy button).
- JS: `loadBlocksForEditor` exists + fetches `/api/blocks` + called at
  init; `blocksByKind`/`blocksByExitSlot` helpers defined; per-slot
  populate calls use the right filter; sizing excludes None; every
  input id is wired to `renderSpecPreview`; `buildSpecFromUi` emits the
  full top-level key set (name/description/regime/entries/filters/exits/
  sizing/constraints/fitness/walkForward); `instanceId:'main'`
  everywhere; Copy-JSON reads `#spec-json-preview` and writes via
  `navigator.clipboard.writeText`; threshold row auto-hides on non-score.
- Server contract: per-block assertions against `GET /api/blocks` —
  every block has id/kind/version/params; every exit block has a valid
  exitSlot; every param has a known type.

**Follow-up (same phase): block descriptions** — optional `description`
field on every block (≤280 chars), surfaced by `/api/blocks`, and
rendered in the spec editor:
- Fixed pickers (regime, 3 exit slots, sizing) each get a muted
  description line below the `<select>` that updates on change.
- Entry/filter rows render the description inline below each row so
  multi-block slots don't lose the hint when the user scans the list.
- All 14 shipping blocks have a 1–2 sentence description backfilled
  from each block's header comment.
- Gates: `spec-api-check` asserts description is string-or-null for
  every block and non-empty for all currently-shipping blocks (regression
  guard); `ui-spec-editor-check` asserts the `-desc` containers exist
  and that `blockDescriptionFor`/`updateBlockDescription` are wired to
  each fixed picker + the row builder.

### 4.3d Per-block param narrowing — ✅ done
Every block instance in the spec editor now shows one control row per
declared param:

    [paramId:type]  [☐ pin]  [min]  [max]  [step]  [↺ reset]

- **Range mode** (default): three number inputs pre-filled from the
  registry's declared bounds. User can narrow but not widen — inputs
  clamp to the registry min/max on blur. The spec emits `{min, max, step}`.
- **Pin mode** (checkbox): collapses to a single value input; spec emits
  `{value: X}`. When a user narrows until `min === max` in range mode,
  the emitter also collapses to `{value}` so the JSON reads as intended.
- **Reset** restores the registry's declared defaults and unpins.
- **Live preview**: every input fires the existing `renderSpecPreview`
  path, so the right-hand JSON panel updates as the user types. No
  debouncing — the build is trivially fast.
- **DOM-as-state**: each `.param-row` stores its registry bounds in
  `dataset.*` and its pin state via the `.pinned` class; no parallel JS
  state array to keep in sync. `readParamOverrides()` walks the DOM on
  every preview build.
- **Fallback**: if a `.spec-params` container hasn't been rendered yet
  (e.g., the select just changed), `blockRefToSpec` falls back to
  `paramToSpecEntry`'s registry-defaults path so the preview never
  crashes mid-render.

Implementation entry points in `ui/app.js`:
- `makeParamControlRow(param, override?)` builds one param row with all
  four inputs + pin checkbox + reset button, and wires live validation
  (out-of-bounds, NaN, and `min > max`).
- `renderParamControls(containerEl, blockId)` (re)builds the full grid
  for a given slot.
- `readParamOverrides(containerEl, block)` returns the `{paramId: entry}`
  dict that slots straight into the spec JSON.
- `readRows(containerId)` replaces `readRowBlockIds` so multi-block
  slots (entries/filters) feed their per-row params container into
  `blockRefToSpec`.

**Verification** — `ui-spec-editor-check.js` (257 checks ✓):
- All 5 `-params` fixed-slot containers present.
- `makeParamControlRow`/`renderParamControls`/`readParamOverrides`
  helpers defined.
- Each fixed picker passes its `-params` container to
  `renderParamControls` on both init and change.
- `makeBlockRow` creates a `.spec-params` container per row and rebuilds
  it on select change.
- `readParamOverrides` emits both `{value}` (pinned) and
  `{min,max,step}` (ranged) shapes.

Still parked for 4.3e: server-side validation of narrowed ranges
against registry bounds (client clamps are advisory — POST /api/specs
will re-validate authoritatively).

### 4.3e Save spec to strategies/ — ✅ done
The spec editor's live JSON preview is now persistable to
`strategies/<name>.json` via a new Save button that POSTs to
`/api/specs`. The server re-runs the authoritative `validateSpec()` —
client-side checks stay advisory, the backend is the gate.

- **Endpoint** (`api/routes.js`): `POST /api/specs` accepts the spec as
  JSON body. Pipeline:
  1. Body must be a non-array object (400 otherwise).
  2. `registry.ensureLoaded()` + `validateSpec()` — all violations
     aggregate into one 400 response whose `error` is the multi-line
     message (same string the user sees when `POST /api/runs` rejects
     a hand-written spec, so failure modes match).
  3. Filename derived from `normalized.name` via `basename()` (blocks
     path traversal).
  4. If the target exists and `?overwrite=1` is not set → 409 with the
     filename echoed back so the UI can prompt.
  5. Atomic write: `writeFile(tmp)` → `rename(tmp, target)`. On rename
     failure the tmp is unlinked and the error bubbles up. The
     transient `hash` field is stripped before persisting — specs on
     disk stay deterministic.
  6. 201 on create, 200 on overwrite; body includes
     `{ ok, filename, name, overwritten }`.
- **UI** (`ui/index.html` + `ui/app.js`): new `Save to strategies/`
  button next to the existing `Copy JSON` button, with a
  `#spec-save-status` line beneath the preview that shows inline
  progress/success/error feedback (no modal dialog for the happy path).
  `saveSpec()` POSTs `buildSpecFromUi()`; on 409 it opens a
  `confirm()` asking to overwrite and retries with `?overwrite=1`.
  400 responses surface the validator's multi-line error verbatim so
  the user can see exactly which param/block is wrong.
- **Safety invariants**: no writes on validation failure (the tmp file
  is never created before validation passes); no `.tmp` files leaked
  after a run (verified by the gate); no hand-rolled path joining
  (every target goes through `resolve(cwd, 'strategies', basename(…))`).

**Verification** — `scripts/spec-api-check.js` (449 checks ✓):
- Happy path: 201 + response shape + file exists on disk with
  `hash` stripped.
- Non-object body → 400 with error mentioning "object".
- Invalid name → 400 with validator message surfaced.
- Out-of-range param (min > max) → 400 + no file leaked.
- Duplicate filename without overwrite → 409 with filename echoed.
- Duplicate filename with `?overwrite=1` → 200 + description on disk
  reflects the new payload (proves it actually re-wrote, not
  short-circuited).
- Tmp-leak guard: strategies/ contains zero `*.tmp` files after run.
- All test files live under `20991231-999-post-spec-test-*` (far-future
  date) and are unlinked in a `finally` so a partial failure never
  pollutes the real spec directory.

**Verification** — `scripts/ui-spec-editor-check.js` (266 checks ✓):
- DOM: `#spec-save` button + `#spec-save-status` line present inside
  `#page-specs`.
- JS: `saveSpec` function defined; references `/api/specs`, a `fetch()`
  call, and `method: 'POST'`; uses `buildSpecFromUi()` as the body;
  handles `?overwrite=1` fallback; 409 path invokes `confirm()`;
  writes into `#spec-save-status`; `#spec-save` click wires to
  `saveSpec`.

### 4.3b Spec picker in the New Run modal — ✅ done
Users can now pick an existing spec from a dropdown in the New Run modal
instead of hand-editing JSON. Minimum-viable UI for spec-mode runs.

- **UI** (`ui/index.html`): new `<select id="modal-spec">` between the
  timeline widget and the GA-param fields. Default option: `"None (legacy
  mode)"` with empty value. Below the select: a muted description line
  (`#modal-spec-desc`) and a red warning line (`#modal-spec-warn`,
  hidden until needed).
- **Wiring** (`ui/app.js`):
  - `loadSpecsIntoModal()` fetches `/api/specs` every time the modal opens
    (so newly-saved specs appear without a page reload) and populates one
    `<option>` per spec. `specsByFilename` caches the response so the
    `change` handler can render the description without re-fetching.
  - `malformed[]` surfaces as a red warning listing the filenames.
  - On Start, `body.spec = filename` is only added when non-empty —
    legacy-mode POSTs stay byte-identical to pre-4.3b.
- **Graceful degradation**: fetch failure logs to console and leaves
  the picker with only "None" — the modal still works.

**Verification** — `scripts/ui-spec-picker-check.js` (22 checks ✓):
- DOM: picker + description + warning elements present in the modal,
  picker sits BEFORE the Population field (discoverable).
- JS: `loadSpecsIntoModal` is defined, fetches `/api/specs`, is awaited
  by the `btn-new-run` handler; Start handler conditionally adds
  `body.spec`; change handler renders descriptions via `specsByFilename`.
- Contract: `GET /api/specs` still returns the shape the picker reads.

### 4.4 UI — fitness config panel — ✅ done
The spec editor's hardcoded fitness config is now a live UI panel.
Weight sliders, cap inputs, and gate inputs all flow through
`readFitnessFromUi()` into `buildSpecFromUi()`, and every "recommended"
chip pulls its value from `GET /api/defaults` — the source of truth is
`DEFAULT_FITNESS` in `engine/spec.js`, not a hand-copied mirror.

- **New endpoint** (`api/routes.js`): `GET /api/defaults` returns
  `{ fitness: {weights, caps, gates}, walkForward: {nWindows, scheme} }`
  via deep-spread so downstream mutation of the frozen module constants
  is impossible. Pure read, no I/O, safe to call on every modal open.
  The walkForward shape is included even though 4.4 only puts UI on
  fitness — future consumers can rely on one endpoint for "recommended
  defaults" instead of mirroring them.
- **UI card** (`ui/index.html`): new Fitness card sits between Sizing
  and the JSON preview on the left column.
  - **Weights**: three range sliders (PF / DD / ret) 0..1 step 0.05,
    each with a live value label, a muted "recommended: X" chip, and a
    shared sum indicator that turns amber if the three weights drift
    more than ±0.01 from 1.0 (same tolerance `engine/spec.js`
    enforces).
  - **Caps**: PF cap + return cap as number inputs.
  - **Gates**: min trades / window (integer), worst-regime PF floor,
    WFE min — with recommended chips next to each.
  - **Reset to recommended** button in the card header re-applies the
    cached defaults + triggers a preview rebuild.
- **Wiring** (`ui/app.js`):
  - `loadFitnessDefaults()` fetches `/api/defaults` at init, caches
    into `fitnessDefaults` (module-level), and calls
    `applyFitnessDefaultsToUi()` which populates inputs + chips. On
    fetch failure it logs and falls back to a hardcoded mirror so the
    editor never hangs waiting for the server.
  - `readFitnessFromUi()` reads every input into the spec's `fitness`
    shape, rounding weights to 2 decimals (sliders emit floats that
    would otherwise land as `0.30000000000000004` in the JSON).
  - `updateWeightLabels()` updates the slider value labels + sum
    indicator on every `input`. Listener wired separately from the
    preview-rebuild loop.
  - `buildSpecFromUi()` now calls `readFitnessFromUi()` instead of a
    hardcoded literal — this is the functional cutover.

**Verification** — `scripts/spec-api-check.js` (467 checks ✓):
- `/api/defaults` returns the exact shape and values of
  `DEFAULT_FITNESS` + `DEFAULT_WALK_FORWARD` from `engine/spec.js`
  (weights sum to 1.0, caps positive, gates in `[0,1]` for wfeMin).
- Two back-to-back calls return identical shape (deep-spread
  immutability check).

**Verification** — `scripts/ui-spec-editor-check.js` (306 checks ✓):
- DOM: Fitness card + every input id + recommended chip + Reset button
  present inside `#page-specs`.
- JS: `loadFitnessDefaults` / `readFitnessFromUi` /
  `applyFitnessDefaultsToUi` / `updateWeightLabels` defined;
  `buildSpecFromUi` uses `readFitnessFromUi` and does NOT hardcode the
  old `weights: {pf:0.5, dd:0.3, ret:0.2}` literal (regression guard);
  every fitness input is wired to `renderSpecPreview`; Reset button
  triggers `applyFitnessDefaultsToUi`; weight sliders update the live
  labels on `input`.

Still parked: walk-forward config (`nWindows`, `scheme`) is surfaced
by `/api/defaults` but the editor keeps the hardcoded `{ nWindows: 5,
scheme: 'anchored' }` for now — a follow-up chunk can wire a small
control row onto the Fitness card once WF tuning becomes a real use
case.

### 4.5 UI — results view
- Per-run: metrics dashboard, trade list, equity curve, **WF report**
  (per-window PFs and WFE), regime breakdown table.
- Compare-runs view: side-by-side WF reports for multiple specs.

**✅ 4.5a — surface spec-mode JSON fields on run-detail page — done.**
- `GET /api/runs/:id` now parses `wf_report_json`, `fitness_breakdown_json`,
  and `regime_breakdown_json` alongside the legacy JSON columns — returning
  live objects instead of strings so the UI doesn't need local `JSON.parse`.
- Run-detail page (`ui/index.html`) got three spec-mode-only cards between
  Strategy Parameters and the Recalculate panel: Fitness Breakdown, Walk-
  Forward Report, and Regime Breakdown. Each card starts `display:none`
  and every h3 carries a `title=` tooltip (same convention as 4.4).
- `ui/app.js` renderers (`renderFitnessBreakdown`, `renderWalkForwardReport`,
  `renderRegimeBreakdown`) are invoked from `openRunDetail` after the fetch.
  Each hides its card on null input so legacy runs render unchanged.
  Formatters (`fmtPf`/`fmtPct`/`fmtWfe`) handle `Infinity` (PF with no
  losing trades) and `NaN` (WFE when mean IS PF = 0). Low-confidence
  regime rows use the same `trades < 5` heuristic as fitness.js.
- Gate: `scripts/ui-run-detail-check.js` covers DOM markers, JS wiring,
  and the server contract end-to-end via an in-memory DuckDB INSERT
  (points at a temp DB via `OPTIMIZER_DB_PATH` so it coexists with the
  long-running dev server).

**✅ 4.5b — compare runs (side-by-side WF view) — done.**
- IN scope:
  - New `#page-compare` in `ui/index.html`: two-column grid with mirrored
    Walk-Forward Report cards (`detail-wf-card-a` / `-b`), each carrying
    its own summary block + per-window table. Mismatch banner and empty-
    state note sit above the grid.
  - `renderWalkForwardReport(wf, idSuffix = '')` refactored to interpolate
    `${idSuffix}` into all `getElementById` calls — same function now
    drives both the run-detail page (suffix `''`) and the compare page
    (suffixes `'-a'` / `'-b'`).
  - Runs-table grew a hidden `.compare-col` column (checkbox per row,
    select-all in the header). A **Compare** toggle button next to
    New Run reveals the column, builds a `selectedRunIds` Set, and
    enables a **Compare (N)** button once at least two runs are ticked.
    Expand-row `colspan` bumped 15 → 16 to cover the new column.
  - Hash routing: clicking Compare sets `location.hash =
    #compare?ids=a,b`, a `hashchange` listener calls
    `routeCompareFromHash`, and the URL is bookmarkable / shareable.
  - `openCompare(ids)` fans out via `Promise.all` over two
    `/api/runs/:id` fetches, renders a header chip row per column
    (Run #id · spec_name · symbol/TF · start · fitness chip), then
    delegates the WF card to the shared helper. A deleted / unreachable
    run shows a red "Run #id not found" header without blanking the
    other column.
  - `highlightCompareWindows(wfA, wfB)` walks `min(len_a, len_b)` OOS
    PF pairs; when the relative gap (`|a-b| / max(|a|,|b|)`) exceeds
    10 %, it tags the winner row with `.cmp-best` (green) and the loser
    with `.cmp-worst` (red). Near-ties and non-finite PFs render plain —
    same 10 % threshold surfaces meaningful divergence without coloring
    noise.
  - Mismatch banner fires when both runs have WF data but disagree on
    `scheme` (anchored vs rolling) or `nWindows` — aligning unlike
    windows side-by-side would be misleading without the callout.
  - `closeCompare()` returns to the optimizer page and hides the
    `#nav-compare` breadcrumb (revealed on open, same pattern as
    `#nav-run-detail`).
  - CSS: `.compare-grid` (1fr 1fr, collapses to single column under
    900 px), `tr.cmp-best` / `tr.cmp-worst` backgrounds, and a yellow
    `.cmp-mismatch` border for the banner.
  - Gate: `scripts/ui-compare-check.js` — three sections (DOM markers,
    JS wiring with a behavioral subsection that extracts
    `highlightCompareWindows` and runs it against a mock DOM, and a
    server-contract round-trip that seeds two runs with contrasting
    WF reports and verifies both come back as parsed objects).
    Reuses the `OPTIMIZER_DB_PATH` temp-DB pattern from 4.5a plus the
    `BigInt.prototype.toJSON` shim so the gate coexists with a running
    dev server.
- DEFERRED (intentionally out of scope for this slice):
  - N-way compare (> 2 runs). Current UI picks the first two ticked.
  - Non-WF compare panels (fitness breakdown delta, regime delta,
    param-diff). Today's compare is WF-only.
  - Server-side `/api/runs/compare` endpoint. We reuse two calls to the
    existing `/api/runs/:id` — no backend changes.
  - Legacy-run compare (no `wf_report_json`). Surfaced via the
    empty-state note rather than synthesized.

**✅ 4.5c — spec-mode detail page fixes — done.**
Two regressions surfaced together in a bug report (Run #58 BTCUSDT 4H):
the Strategy Parameters card rendered empty and Recalculate produced $0.
Both had the same root cause — legacy paths assumed flat gene keys /
the JM Simple 3TP simulator.
- `ui/app.js`: `openRunDetail` now branches on `run.spec_hash`. Pulled
  the param-card rendering out of the inline loop into two helpers —
  `renderLegacyGeneCards` (unchanged behaviour for legacy runs, still
  reads `PARAM_LABELS`) and `renderSpecGeneCards` (walks the gene,
  parses qualified IDs into block / instance / param, groups cards
  under the block name with the qualified ID as a hover tooltip).
  `_meta.entries.threshold` surfaces as a standalone "Entries" card at
  the top; other `_meta.*` keys are intentionally dropped.
- `api/routes.js` (`GET /api/runs/:id/trades`): new spec-mode branch
  mirrors `island-worker` — `registry.ensureLoaded()` → `getSpec` →
  `validateSpec` → `buildParamSpace` → `loadDataBundle` → `runSpec`
  with `collectTrades` + `collectEquity`. Response gains a `specMode`
  flag so the UI can tell which engine produced the numbers. A missing
  spec row returns 404 rather than silently falling through. Legacy
  branch is preserved verbatim for runs without `spec_hash`.
- `?sizing=flat` is ignored in the spec branch (sizing is spec-owned)
  but still echoed in the response to keep the UI's dropdown stable.
- Gate: `scripts/ui-spec-recalc-check.js` — static import / branch
  checks on routes.js, static + behavioral tests on the two card
  renderers (extracted and run against mock genes), and a server
  round-trip proving a run with a missing `spec_hash` returns 404 with
  a spec-not-found error (the spec branch fired).

### 4.6 Pine export

**✅ 4.6 — Generate Pine indicator button on run-detail — done.**
- IN scope (shipped):
  - `engine/pine-codegen.js` exports `canonicalJson()` + `geneHash()`
    so the API endpoint and CLI scripts (`pine-export.js`,
    `pine-deploy.js`) produce byte-identical filenames for the same
    `(spec, gene)` pair. CLI scripts refactored to import these
    rather than maintaining local copies.
  - **POST `/api/runs/:id/pine-export`** — pulls the stored spec via
    `getSpec(spec_hash)`, runs `validateSpec` → `buildParamSpace` →
    `paramSpace.hydrate(best_gene)` → `generateEntryAlertsPine()`,
    writes a content-addressable file
    `pine/generated/<spec.name>-<hash12>.pine`, and returns
    `{ path, filename, hash12, title, shortTitle, bytes, lines, source, reused }`.
    Idempotent: if the target file already exists, returns
    `reused: true` without rewriting. Output dir is overridable via
    `OPTIMIZER_PINE_OUT_DIR` (gate uses tmpdir to avoid dirtying
    `pine/generated/`). Error matrix: 404 unknown run, 400 legacy
    run (no spec_hash), 400 missing best_gene, 404 missing spec, 409
    hydrate failure (spec edited post-run).
  - **UI**: "Pine Export" card on the run-detail page with a
    "Generate Pine indicator" button. `openRunDetail` toggles the
    button's disabled state on `run.spec_hash` (legacy runs get a
    disabled button + tooltip explaining "spec-mode only — legacy GA
    runs have no spec to codegen from"). On success, renders
    title / shortTitle / filename / hash / size / path plus a
    collapsible HTML-escaped source preview, and surfaces
    "Already generated" when `reused: true`.
  - Regression gate: `scripts/ui-pine-export-check.js` (47 checks)
    covers DOM declarations, JS wiring (button-state branch, fetch
    URL, escape-on-render, status reset), and full server contract:
    happy-path response shape + filename pattern + on-disk file
    presence; idempotency (re-call returns `reused: true` with the
    same path); 404 unknown run; 400 legacy run; 400 missing-gene
    run; 404 missing-spec run.
- DEFERRED:
  - **Auto-push to TradingView from the UI button.** MEMORY.md says
    `pine-push.js` destroys current editor content; we'd need a
    conflict-detection step (Pine script-name collision check via the
    TV API) before adding a one-click push. Until then, the UI
    surfaces the deploy command as a "Next step" hint and the user
    runs `node scripts/pine-deploy.js` themselves.
  - **`mode: "inputs"` codegen.** All values are emitted as numeric
    literals ("frozen" mode) to match the parity-gate reference
    indicator. Generic tunable-input output is a separate task.
  - **Filter / regime codegen review on real specs.** Code paths exist
    in `pine-codegen.js` but the legacy spec only exercises entry
    blocks. Coverage will fall out naturally as we add filter-heavy
    specs in Phase 4.7+.

- (Original scope — kept for context):
  - "Generate Pine indicator" button per winning run.
  - Runs codegen over active (entry + filter + regime) blocks with the
    tuned params, writes `pine/generated/<spec-name>-<hash>.pine`.
  - Auto-push via `tools/pine-push.js`. **NEVER** overwrite an existing
    editor script without confirmation — user feedback note already
    captured in MEMORY.md.

### 4.7 Deployment (= portfolio automation) — SPEC LOCKED 2026-04-15

**Scope:** turn a winning run into a live (paper-mode) trading loop —
TV indicator pushed → alerts hit our webhook → dispatcher updates a
position ledger → reconciler watches for drift. NO real-money execution
in 4.7; live tier explicitly disabled in code, schema, and UI.

#### Architectural overview

**State machine (DuckDB is source of truth):**
```
runs.status=completed
        │  (user clicks "Deploy" on a winning spec-mode run)
        ▼
deployments.status=draft         [config prepared, not serving webhooks]
        │  (Pine pushed via existing pine-deploy + secret minted)
        ▼
deployments.status=armed         [webhook URL live, mode=paper]
        │  (TV alert → webhook_events row → dispatcher)
        ▼
positions.state=opening → open   [paper fill simulated OR live-stub logged]
        │  (TP/SL/Structural/Reversal alert)
        ▼
positions.state=closing → closed [reconciliation records realized P&L]
        │
        ▼
deployments.status=paused|retired (kill-switched or explicitly retired)
```

**Storage:** all state in DuckDB. Files are artifacts only — generated
`.pine` under `pine/generated/`, plus a per-deployment append-only
`data/deployments/<id>/events.jsonl` audit trail (the JSONL is also the
ingest queue once we split the webhookd process — see 4.7d).

**Boundary — we own / exchange owns:**
- WE own: signal generation (Pine on TV), webhook ingestion, dedup, the
  canonical position ledger (our model of what *should* be true),
  reconciliation, P&L accounting.
- EXCHANGE owns: actual fills, fees, slippage, position state. In 4.7
  the "exchange" is `paper` (simulated via `engine/execution-costs.js`
  shared with the backtest) or `live-stub` (logs the order it *would*
  have sent, returns a fake fill). The `adapters/exchange.js` interface
  is the swap point for a future real adapter.

#### Safety model (layered, each independently sufficient)

1. **Tier flag per deployment** — `mode ∈ {dry-run, paper, live-stub}`.
   No `live` value in the CHECK constraint. Mode change requires DB
   update + server restart; no UI path in 4.7.
2. **Global kill switch** — env var `DEPLOYMENT_KILL_SWITCH=1` +
   `system.kill_switch` row. Tripping pauses dispatch but does NOT
   auto-close positions (humans decide).
3. **Per-deployment circuit breakers** — `max_position_size`,
   `max_loss_per_day_usd`, `max_consecutive_losses`,
   `max_positions_open`. Breach → `status=paused` with `pause_reason`.
   Unpause is manual.
4. **Alert dedup** — `UNIQUE(deployment_id, bar_time, action, direction)`.
   Duplicate payloads return 200 + `deduped:true` so TV stops retrying.
5. **HMAC-signed webhooks** — `HMAC-SHA256(body, secret)` validated
   with `crypto.timingSafeEqual`. Bad sig → 401, logged but not
   dispatched.
6. **Staleness guard** — reject `abs(now - payload.bar_time) > 2*tf`.
   Protects against replay and chart-scrolled-back-in-time cases.
7. **Per-symbol locks** — only one open position per
   `(deployment, symbol)`. Second "open" while position=open is logged
   as a drift event, not acted on.

#### Tax pool — DEFERRED to Phase 4.8 / Phase 5

The tax pool is an accounting abstraction with no consumer until the AI
idea generator wants to spend GPU budget. Building it now means
designing a ledger with no reader. **Mitigation:** capture
`realized_pnl_usd` on every closed `positions` row from day one — the
pool is derivable retroactively from the trade log, no schema debt.

#### Build vs stub — exchange adapter is STUBBED in 4.7

Real execution would require API keys, rate-limit handling, fill
reconciliation against the exchange's state, and risk thinking the rest
of the system isn't ready for. The "NO real money" constraint makes
this decision for us. The `adapters/exchange.js` interface
(`{ openPosition, closePosition, getPosition, listPositions }`) is the
swap point — `paper` and `live-stub` are both stub impls; a future
`binance-perp` adapter implements the same interface and the dispatcher
won't notice.

---

#### Sub-phases

##### ✅ 4.7a — Webhook receiver + dedup (foundations) — done.
- IN scope (shipped):
  - **Schema** (`db/schema.sql`): `deployments` table with CHECK
    constraints on `mode IN ('dry-run','paper','live-stub')` (no `live`
    value — defense in depth) and `status IN ('draft','armed','paused',
    'retired')`. `webhook_events` table with
    `UNIQUE(deployment_id, dedup_key)`.
  - **Helpers** (`db/deployments.js`): `createDeployment` (mints
    64-hex secret via `randomBytes(32)`), `getDeployment`,
    `listDeployments({status})`, `recordWebhookEvent` (probe-then-insert
    dedup), `countWebhookEvents`, plus exported `mintSecret` + `dedupKey`
    so the gate can compose colliding keys.
  - **Endpoints** (`api/routes.js`):
    - `POST /api/deployments` — draft from a run; rejects legacy runs
      and runs without `best_gene` with the same gating as Pine export.
    - `GET /api/deployments` — list with secret REDACTED to a 4-char
      preview (`secret_key_preview`), so log-streaming can't leak.
    - `GET /api/deployments/:id` — single deployment, secret revealed
      (single-user-box convention; UI gates the reveal client-side).
    - `POST /webhook/:deployment_id/:secret` — TV alert receiver.
      Bearer-secret-in-URL auth via `crypto.timingSafeEqual` (constant
      time, padded for length safety). Failed-auth attempts STILL get
      persisted (signature_ok=false) for audit. Body cap 4 KB → 413,
      stale (>2*tf) → 400, future-dated > 1tf → 400, missing
      `action`/`time` → 400, unknown deployment → 404. Duplicates
      (same dedup_key) return 200 + `deduped:true` + the original
      `event_id` so callers can correlate.
  - **Process topology:** receiver runs in the same Express process —
    splits to a separate `webhookd` in 4.7d.
- DEFERRED:
  - Position model, dispatcher (4.7b)
  - UI deploy button, Pine auto-push linkage (4.7c)
  - `webhookd` process split, reconciler (4.7d)
  - Independent price feed, live-stub adapter (4.7e)
  - Status transitions (`arm`, `pause`, `retire`) — needed by 4.7c
  - Tax pool (Phase 4.8 / Phase 5)
- Regression gate `scripts/deployment-webhook-check.js` — **93 checks**,
  three-section pattern: (1) schema columns + DB-level CHECK rejects
  `mode='live'`; (2) `db/deployments.js` round-trips + helper rejects
  `mode='live'`; (3) full server contract — happy path, redaction,
  reveal-by-id, dedup, bad-secret-with-audit, unknown deployment, stale,
  missing fields, body too large, AND a "close action does NOT dedup
  with prior open" check (the dispatcher in 4.7b will rely on this to
  distinguish entries from exits on the same bar).
- Notes:
  - "HMAC" in the original spec was aspirational. TV's webhook config
    can't add custom headers, so per-alert body MAC is impossible —
    the bearer-secret-in-URL pattern is the actual auth, equivalent
    in this threat model.
  - Schema is migration-safe (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS + the same
    WAL-replay-safe pattern from the existing schema migrations).

#### Wundertrading pivot (decided 2026-04-16)

User revealed they use **Wundertrading** for exchange execution via
Signal Bots that accept webhooks. This replaces the planned dispatcher,
position ledger, reconciler, and exchange adapter (4.7b–e original
scope). The revised flow:

1. Optimizer finds best gene → Pine codegen emits a frozen indicator
2. TV alert fires on entry signal → sends Wundertrading-compatible JSON
   to the Signal Bot's webhook URL
3. Wundertrading opens position + places TP/SL as **conditional orders
   on the exchange** (ATR-based levels computed at alert time from the
   gene's frozen exit params)
4. Exchange handles TP/SL exits natively; structural/time exits fire a
   separate EXIT-ALL alert via Pine → Wundertrading

**Why this is better:** TPs and SLs as exchange conditional orders are
not reliant on the TV alert pipeline. If TV goes down after the entry,
the exchange still holds the stops — a qualitative reliability
improvement over our planned Pine-alert-driven exit flow.

**Wundertrading webhook security:** bearer-URL auth (the URL is the
secret). Same model as 4.7a. TV can't add custom headers, so all
TV-webhook integrations use this pattern. Mitigation: treat the URL
as a secret; Wundertrading's per-bot capital limits cap blast radius.

The 4.7a webhook receiver remains available as an optional parallel
logging endpoint (TV supports multiple webhook URLs per alert).

**Deployment topology:** 1 Wundertrading Signal Bot per strategy,
connected to exactly 1 exchange sub-account, with at most 1 open
trade at any time. Consequences:
- **Portfolio field is moot** — every TP closes the full position
  (`portfolio: 1`). The multi-TP ladder becomes "whichever level
  price reaches first, close everything" — matches our Pine v1
  simplification.
- **Sizing is trivial** — `amountPerTrade` as a fraction applies to
  a dedicated sub-account. No cross-strategy margin math.
- **P&L attribution is automatic** — one sub-account per strategy
  means exchange-level P&L *is* strategy-level P&L.

##### 4.7b (revised) — Wundertrading-compatible Pine alert payloads

**Goal:** update `engine/pine-codegen.js` so generated indicators emit
Wundertrading Signal Bot-compatible JSON in their `alert()` calls. The
gene's frozen TP/SL parameters are computed into absolute prices at
alert time and embedded in the JSON payload, so Wundertrading can place
them as conditional orders on the exchange.

**Why now:** this is the only remaining code change needed for a working
end-to-end flow: optimizer → Pine → TV alert → Wundertrading → exchange.

**Wundertrading JSON spec** (from their Signal Bot Comprehensive JSON
Guide):
```json
{
  "code": "ENTER-LONG",
  "orderType": "market",
  "amountPerTradeType": "percents",
  "amountPerTrade": 0.1,
  "leverage": 5,
  "takeProfits": [
    {"price": 148.50, "portfolio": 1},
    {"price": 155.00, "portfolio": 1},
    {"price": 162.00, "portfolio": 1}
  ],
  "stopLoss": {"price": 138.00},
  "placeConditionalOrdersOnExchange": true,
  "reduceOnly": true
}
```

Key fields: `code` = bot trigger comment; `takeProfits` = array of up
to 6 levels with absolute prices + portfolio fraction (0,1] to close;
`stopLoss` = single level with absolute price; `reduceOnly` = safety
flag preventing accidental position opens. Wundertrading supports
`placeConditionalOrdersOnExchange: true` which places TPs/SLs as
actual orders on the exchange (not just server-side monitoring).

**IN scope:**
- **New Pine inputs** (Webhook group, alongside existing `i_tickerOverride`):
  - `i_posSize` (float, default 0.1) — fraction of portfolio per trade.
    Wundertrading `amountPerTrade` with `amountPerTradeType: "percents"`
    (0.1 = 10%).
  - `i_leverage` (int, default 1) — leverage multiplier [1, 125].
  - `i_codeLong` (string, default `"ENTER-LONG"`) — Wundertrading bot
    comment code for long entries.
  - `i_codeShort` (string, default `"ENTER-SHORT"`) — code for short entries.
  - `i_codeExit` (string, default `"EXIT-ALL"`) — code for structural /
    time exits. TPs/SLs don't use this — they're exchange-side.
- **Refactored `f_entry_json(dir)`** — multi-line Pine function that
  builds the Wundertrading JSON:
  - Computes `is_long` from `dir` parameter.
  - Reads ATR from the same series the exit state machine uses
    (`nz(atr_<len>[1])` — prior bar's ATR, matching the backtest's
    fill-at-next-bar-open convention).
  - Computes TP prices: for each active tranche (tpNPct > 0),
    `close ± ATR × tpNMult`. Tranche mults are frozen from the gene
    as numeric literals. All TPs use `portfolio: 1` (full-close on
    first hit — 1 bot / 1 sub-account / max 1 trade topology).
  - Computes SL price: `close ∓ ATR × atrSL` from the hardStop block.
  - Assembles JSON: `code`, `orderType: "market"`,
    `amountPerTradeType: "percents"`, `amountPerTrade: i_posSize`,
    `leverage: i_leverage`, `takeProfits: [...]`, `stopLoss: {price: ...}`,
    `placeConditionalOrdersOnExchange: true`, `reduceOnly: true`.
- **Refactored `f_exit_json(dir, reason)`** — minimal close payload:
  `{"code":"<i_codeExit>","orderType":"market","reduceOnly":true}`.
  Only fired for exits that exchange conditional orders can't handle.
- **Exit alert gating:** `alert(f_exit_json(...))` fires ONLY when
  `bar_exit_reason` is `"Structural"`, `"Time"`, or `"Reversal"` —
  NOT for `"TP1"`/`"TP2"`/`"TP3"`/`"SL"`/`"ESL"` (those are handled
  by the exchange's conditional orders). Reversal entries (goShort
  while long) are also handled by Wundertrading's swing mode — the
  ENTER-SHORT signal auto-closes the open long — so in practice only
  Structural and Time exits produce an EXIT-ALL alert.
- **Exit state machine PRESERVED** for chart visualization. The
  plotshape/label arrows still fire on all exit types so the chart
  overlay shows the complete picture. Only the `alert()` dispatch path
  changes.
- **Graceful degradation** (specs without full exit config):
  - No `target` block → `takeProfits` array omitted from JSON
  - No `hardStop` block → `stopLoss` omitted from JSON
  - Neither → alert carries entry + sizing only, no TP/SL
    (user configures them in Wundertrading's form settings instead)
- **ATR series reuse:** TP/SL computation uses the same ATR series
  the exit state machine already declares (e.g., `atr_14`). No new
  indicator series needed.
- **`f_ts()` preserved** — not part of the Wundertrading payload, but
  kept for the parallel logging path (our 4.7a webhook) and for any
  future dual-webhook use.

**Dual-webhook note:** TV allows multiple webhook URLs per alert but
only ONE message per alert. The Wundertrading JSON is the primary
format. Our 4.7a webhook (`POST /webhook/:id/:secret`) still receives
the same payload — it logs `raw_body` as-is. The 4.7a dedup key
computation (`dedupKey()` in `db/deployments.js`) may need a minor
update to extract `action`/`direction` from the Wundertrading `code`
field (e.g. `ENTER-LONG` → action=`open`, direction=`long`), OR we
accept the new key shape and just key on `code` + `bar_time`. Either
way this is a small follow-up, not blocking.

**DEFERRED:**
- Wundertrading DCA settings in the alert JSON (complex, user can
  configure DCA in the bot's form settings if needed)
- Limit order support (market orders only in v1)
- Move-to-breakeven automation via Wundertrading's `moveToBreakeven`
  field (exchange-side logic, our backtest doesn't model it yet)
- `amountPerTradeType` as an input (hardcoded to `"percents"` — user
  can override in TV's alert message editor if needed)
- Trailing stop in Wundertrading format (their trailing stop is
  percentage-based, not ATR-based — format mismatch with our
  `structuralExit` block)

**Gate (`scripts/pine-wundertrading-check.js`):**
- [1] **Codegen output**: generate Pine from the migration-gate spec +
  a known gene (same fixture as `ui-pine-export-check.js`). Verify:
  - New inputs present in Webhook group: `i_posSize`, `i_leverage`,
    `i_codeLong`, `i_codeShort`, `i_codeExit` with correct types and
    defaults.
  - `f_entry_json` contains Wundertrading fields: `code`, `orderType`,
    `amountPerTradeType`, `amountPerTrade`, `leverage`, `takeProfits`,
    `stopLoss`, `placeConditionalOrdersOnExchange`, `reduceOnly`.
  - TP prices use correct formula direction-aware:
    long = `close + ATR × mult`, short = `close - ATR × mult`.
  - SL price uses correct formula: long = `close - ATR × atrSL`,
    short = `close + ATR × atrSL`.
  - Only active tranches (tpNPct > 0) emitted in the TP array.
  - All TPs use `portfolio: 1` (full-close-on-first-hit topology).
- [2] **Exit alert gating**: verify `alert(f_exit_json(...))` is guarded
  by `bar_exit_reason` check — fires for Structural/Time/Reversal, NOT
  for TP/SL/ESL.
- [3] **Graceful degradation**: generate Pine from a synthetic spec
  with no target block → `takeProfits` absent from JSON. No hardStop →
  `stopLoss` absent. Neither → entry-only alert.
- [4] **Backward compatibility**: exit state machine visualization
  (plotshape/label arrows) unchanged from 4.6 output. Entry/exit arrows
  still render on the chart regardless of alert format.

**Risks:**
- **ATR[1] lag**: the ATR value for TP/SL computation is the prior
  bar's ATR (`nz(atr_<len>[1])`), same offset the backtest runtime
  uses for fill-at-next-bar-open. If the alert fires at bar close,
  the TP/SL prices reflect the prior bar's volatility — acceptable
  and consistent with backtested results.
- **Pine v5 string length**: deeply nested JSON as a single-line string
  concatenation. Pine v5's max string length is 4096 chars. Our payload
  with 3 TPs is ~350 chars — well within limits even with 6 TPs.

**Exit:** generate Pine for the migration-gate spec, paste the entry
alert payload into a Wundertrading test bot, verify the JSON is
accepted and TPs/SLs appear as conditional orders on the exchange.

##### 4.7c (revised) — Deploy-from-run UI (Wundertrading setup guide)

**Goal:** one-click "Deploy" on run-detail that generates Pine and
shows a guided setup checklist for Wundertrading bot configuration:
webhook URL, required bot settings, alert message template.

**IN scope:**
- "Deploy" button on run-detail (spec-mode only, gates same as 4.6).
- Modal / expanded card:
  - Pine filename + generate button (reuses 4.6's codegen endpoint).
  - Wundertrading setup checklist:
    1. Create Signal Bot in Wundertrading dashboard
    2. Copy the bot's webhook URL
    3. Set up TV alert on the generated indicator
    4. Paste bot webhook URL as TV alert destination
    5. Alert message: already in the Pine's `alert()` calls (explain
       that TV uses the indicator's `alert()` output automatically)
  - Deployment record creation (links run → deployment for logging
    via our 4.7a webhook, optional).
- Deployments list page: status, last signal time, link to Wundertrading.

**DEFERRED:** arm/pause/retire lifecycle (manual for now), real-time
signal monitoring, Wundertrading API integration for automated bot
setup.

##### 4.7d / 4.7e — SUPERSEDED by Wundertrading integration

The original dispatcher, position ledger, reconciler, process split,
independent price feed, and live-stub adapter are no longer needed.
Wundertrading handles:
- **Exchange execution** — Signal Bot → exchange order
- **TP/SL management** — conditional orders on exchange
- **Position tracking** — Wundertrading dashboard + exchange
- **Analytics and trade visibility** — Wundertrading dashboard
- **Reconciliation** — Wundertrading monitors position state

The independent price feed concept (verify TV's price against our
candle DB) could be resurrected as a lightweight monitoring tool if
needed, but is not on the critical path.

---

#### Critical files (touched across 4.7)
- `db/schema.sql` — 2 new tables (deployments, webhook_events) ✅ 4.7a
- `db/deployments.js` — CRUD helpers ✅ 4.7a
- `api/routes.js` — webhook + deployments endpoints ✅ 4.7a
- `engine/pine-codegen.js` — Wundertrading JSON alert format (4.7b)
- `ui/index.html` + `ui/app.js` — Deploy button, setup guide (4.7c)
- `scripts/pine-deploy.js` — already exists, reused by Deploy flow

---

## 5. Phase 5 — AI-powered strategy idea generator (parked)

Separate effort. High-level vision:

- Scrape / ingest YouTube trading channels, Reddit (r/algotrading, r/Daytrading,
  r/Forex, r/CryptoCurrency), trading blogs.
- Summarize strategies via LLM into structured "idea" documents.
- Map ideas to block combinations in the existing library — flag missing blocks
  that would need to be authored.
- Auto-generate draft specs from mapped ideas, queue them for optimization.
- Use Phase 4's "tax" pool to fund GPU time for the optimizer.

Parked until Phases 1–4 are solid. Too many moving parts to start on it now.

---

## 6. Deferred features

Things we intentionally postponed from earlier design discussions.

### Pyramiding / scale-in entries

**What:** Allow entry blocks to ADD to an open position on the same side, not
just open-when-flat. Day traders use this pattern heavily — core position,
add on confirmation, add again on continuation.

**Why deferred:** Runtime currently enforces "one position at a time; sub-
positions are for scale-OUT only" (tranches set up by the target block at
entry time via `onPositionOpen`). Supporting scale-IN requires:

1. Entry block return shape extension: `{ long: 1, addToOpen: true }` (or a
   dedicated `addBlocks` slot).
2. Runtime allows entry evaluation while a position is open AND on the
   SAME side (currently only allowed for opposing reversals).
3. Sizing block called again per add, with `ctx.addIndex` so size can taper
   (e.g., half-size adds).
4. Metrics: per-add entry tracking so we can attribute PnL by tranche
   (already works — each `sub` PnLs independently).
5. Pine codegen: emit add-entry alerts, not just initial-entry alerts.

**Design notes when we pick it up:**
- Keep the "one concurrent position" invariant. Adds extend the existing
  position, they don't open a new one.
- Cap adds per position with a spec-level `maxAdds` param on the entry slot.
- Require all adds to be same-direction as the open position (reversals
  remain a separate code path).
- Sizing block's `ctx.addIndex` starts at 1 for first add; 0 means initial
  entry.
- Block-level hook: existing `onPositionOpen` fires on initial entry only;
  add `onPositionAdd(position, newSub, ctx)` parallel to it so the target
  block can attach per-add metadata (e.g., a new TP level for the add's
  sub-position).

**Relationship to existing code:**
- `position.subs` already supports N tranches — scale-in just appends.
- `runtime.js` 5e gating logic needs expansion (currently flat OR reversal →
  new entry; new case: open-same-side-within-maxAdds → add).
- No changes to indicator cache, data bundle, or spec format (other than
  optional `entries.maxAdds`).

### Random sizing within bounds

Considered during chunk 6.5 design, **dropped**. Random sizing contradicts
the whole point of optimization — we're trying to find the size that
maximizes fitness, not a random one. Mentioned for completeness only.

### Portfolio-level allocation across strategies

Once multiple strategies are deployed concurrently, allocate capital across
them based on rolling fitness. Not in scope until we have several live.

### Live-trading adapter

Alerts → webhook → exchange order. Out of scope; we stub a webhook target.

### Spread / order-book aware filters

Requires tick-level or L2 data. Current pipeline is minute-bar aggregation.
Park until we have a data source.

### Remote optimizer workers (multi-machine drain)

**What:** let a separate process — or a separate *machine* — drain the run
queue so the UI server and the GA are decoupled. Today everything runs in
one Node process on the Windows box (Phase 4.2b). That's fine for a
solo user, but a few scenarios push toward a second process:

- Running the UI on a laptop while the GA eats the Windows RTX 3090 all
  weekend.
- Farming out runs to a rented GPU box for a burst (Phase 5 feedstock).
- Rolling the UI process independently of a long-running GA — today a
  UI restart kills the GA in flight (stale-lease recovery requeues it,
  but the user loses the generation-log progress).

**Why deferred:** two blockers make this non-trivial, and neither is
urgent while single-process works:

1. **DuckDB is single-writer per DB file.** A second Node process can't
   just open the same `optimizer.duckdb` and call the queue helpers —
   the UI server holds an exclusive lock. The fix is either:
   - (a) An HTTP API surface on the UI server: `POST /api/queue/claim`,
     `POST /api/queue/:id/heartbeat`, `POST /api/queue/:id/complete`.
     The worker becomes an authenticated client; the UI server remains
     the sole DB writer. This is the recommended path — fits the
     existing Express app, reuses `db/queue.js` unchanged.
   - (b) DuckDB's experimental multi-writer attach mode. Risky; not
     production-ready as of the versions we use.
2. **Candle transport.** The worker needs the same candle bytes the UI
   server has. Either ship them over HTTP per claim (slow for a
   10k-bar SAB), mount a shared filesystem, or have the worker maintain
   its own candle ingester. All fine, but each has tradeoffs.

**When we pick this up**, the design sketch is:
- `scripts/queue-worker.js` as a daemon: loop `claim → heartbeat →
  runOptimization → complete`. Reuses `optimizer/runner.js` unchanged.
- API endpoints on the UI server that proxy `db/queue.js` helpers with
  a shared-secret bearer token (HMAC over body for integrity).
- Candle bootstrap: either `GET /api/candles/:symbol/:tf.sab` returning
  the raw SharedArrayBuffer payload, or a Parquet/CSV stream. Prefer
  SAB for zero-copy into the worker's `runOptimization`.
- Heartbeat interval tuned to the network (30s over LAN, shorter for
  same-host). `recoverStaleRuns({ timeoutMs })` already handles dead
  workers — no new FSM.

No priority until the single-process setup hits a real wall.

### Cross-block parameter aliasing / equality constraints

**Problem:** the legacy JM Simple 3TP port (`strategies/20260414-001-jm-
simple-3tp-legacy.json`) needs two params to be IDENTICAL across two
block instances each:

- `atrLen` on `atrHardStop` must equal `atrLen` on `atrScaleOutTarget`
- `stochLen` + `stochSmth` on `stochCross` must equal those on
  `structuralExit`

Without this, the GA optimizes each independently and the two instances
drift apart. The `==` constraint op would express it but isn't supported
(validator's `CONSTRAINT_OPS` is `< <= > >= !=`). The chunk-7 smoke
pins matching values by hand; chunk 8's parity test will too.

**Options when we pick it up:**

1. **Add `==` to `CONSTRAINT_OPS`** with a `clamp-lhs` repair that sets
   lhs = rhs (simple, obvious, but doesn't dedup the genome — both genes
   still exist and mutate independently, constraint-repair just overrides
   one on the way in).
2. **Spec-level param aliases** — e.g.
   ```json
   "aliases": [
     { "from": "atrScaleOutTarget.main.atrLen",
       "to":   "atrHardStop.main.atrLen" }
   ]
   ```
   `buildParamSpace` drops the aliased gene from `PARAMS` and writes the
   hydrated value from the source. Cleaner — only one gene in the genome,
   constraint-repair never has to fire.
3. **Shared-indicator references in block deps** — orthogonal to params:
   if two blocks both request `base:atr:14`, the cache already dedups
   computation. The block-params problem remains though (they each declare
   atrLen separately in their indicatorDeps call).

**Recommendation:** option 2 (aliases) — fewer moving parts at runtime,
and spec authors can read the spec and see exactly which params are
coupled. Add ~chunk 9 once the migration gate is green.

### Sum/expression constraints

Related. Legacy JM Simple 3TP had `tp1Pct + tp2Pct ≤ 90` (the remainder
becomes tp3Pct, and zero-sized tranches are wasteful). The current
constraint grammar only supports binary comparisons between a qid and
a qid-or-literal. Extending to `sum(a,b) <= 90` or general expressions
isn't urgent — for the migration gate we rely on the GA preferring
constraint-respecting genomes naturally (small loss on fitness). Revisit
if we see the population getting stuck against this wall.

## 7. Open questions

Design calls we haven't yet made — flag them when they come up.

- **HTF warmup edge case:** if a base bar falls inside the first HTF bar
  (which hasn't closed yet), HTF_NONE is returned. Blocks currently handle
  this individually. Should the runtime skip these bars globally? Probably
  no — blocks that don't depend on HTF shouldn't be gated on HTF warmup.
  Confirmed for now: blocks guard themselves.

- **Multiple regime blocks?** Spec currently allows one regime slot. Some
  strategies might want trend-regime × vol-regime (e.g., "trending-high-vol"
  vs "ranging-low-vol"). Could extend regime slot to array with label
  concatenation. Hold until a concrete use case demands it.

- **Partial fills / position scaling in Pine export:** Pine's `strategy.entry`
  with pyramiding handles this natively but the *indicator* (alerts) version
  would need to emit separate alert lines per tranche. Solvable; decide when
  we build Pine codegen.

- **Commission override per run:** We hardcode 0.06%/side. Different exchanges
  and asset classes have different rates. Should come from the run config,
  not the spec (it's an execution concern, not a strategy concern).

- **Short selling + funding rates:** Currently we model shorts symmetrically.
  Crypto perpetuals have funding; spot shorts have borrow cost. Not modeled.
  Probably need a `fundingBps` in run config like commission.

**Convention:** when something from this file gets picked up, move its
entry to an in-progress state (e.g., "🟡 in progress") rather than deleting
it. When it's done, mark ✅ and leave it in place for historical context.
